## Session 3.1

- Review Assignments
- **Lecture** Button Terminology
- **Demo** Embedded Buttons

---

### Button Terminology

- **State**: on (connected, electrons can flow) or off (disconnected, electrons cannot flow)
- **Acutation**: the physical action necessary to change the state of a switch / button i.e. push, slide, flip, rotate
  - **Momentary**: remain connected when **actuated** i.e. the push buttons are connected as long as we continue pushing them. When we release they return to their **normal position** (**NO** or **NC**)
  - **Toggle**: stay in one state until actuated to a different state i.e. a light switch

---

### Button Terminology

- **Pole**: the number of circuits one switch can control simultaneously. We will use/make **single pole** switches
- **Throws**: the number of positions a switch can be thrown to. We will use/make **single throw** switches

Typically we refer to buttons by describing their method of actuation as well as quantity of poles and throws. For example: a **Single Pole Single Throw Push-button**

## DIY Buttons

**DIY Buttons** are buttons / switches made using only conductive tape and cardboard / paper. Though technologically simple they can easily be disguised or embedded in order to produce different meanings / feelings when participants interact with them. 

Demo: some examples of "DIY Buttons" will be presented.
